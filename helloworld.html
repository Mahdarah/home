    <p class="articletext">Hello, everyone reading this! This is a  blog, as you can see. But this is <em><b>not</b></em> just any old blog. It's my blog. One that I build from scratch. I know, I know, that sounds pretentious, but it's hard not to gloat (for me at least) over something you've built. I built this website using html, css, and JavaScript. For those of you who don't know much about them, they sound a lot scarier than they actually are. Anyway, back to the original topic of discussion, my blog. I intend to make blog posts when I want to, I don't plan to ever have a fixed schedule. This website is just for fun, a nice place for me to post my ramblings. There will never be any ads on this page, there is no need for them, this website is free, thanks to Github. Anyway, as I'm writing this I've already posted a blog post about my first game, so go take a gander at that, if you're interested. Thanks for reading all of this, hope you stick around for more of my nonsense ramblings.</p>
