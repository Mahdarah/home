    <p class="articletext">Hello, everyone reading this! Welcome to my blog! One that I build from scratch! I built this website using html, css, and JavaScript. For those of you who don't know much about them, they sound a lot scarier than they actually are. Anyway, back to the original topic of discussion, my blog. I intend to make blog posts when I want to, I don't plan to ever have a fixed schedule. This website is just for pleasure, a friendly place for me to post my ramblings. There will never be any ads on this page, there is no need for them, this website costs nothing to maintain thanks to Github. Anyway, as I'm writing this I've already posted one other blog post about my first game, so go read that if you're intrested. Thanks for reading all of this, hope you stick around for more of my nonsense.</p>
