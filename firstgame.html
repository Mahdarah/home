    <p class=articletext>On November 27th, 2017, I uploaded my first game to the internet. It sounds a lot more dramatic than it really was. In all honesty I was just sitting at my computer late at night, desperately trying to finish so I could go to sleep. I drank 2 redbulls earlier and my body was just about ready to give up. But I did it. The game was confusing, and not very well made. It had okay music, but shitty graphics and rough, unpolished programming. But I'm glad I did it. I've tried making games for game jams before but I'd never been able to actually finish one. My game was almost universally panned. Obviously. The majority of people didn't even bother figuring out how to play it. But, for the people who did, they rated it mediocre at worst and decent at best. Honestly, just seeing a few people rate me above 20th place made me happy. That is the best thing I could have wished for. The process was grueling. But now I <em>want</em> to make more. I want to become better. And now, with everyone's insights into my game, I finally can.</p>
