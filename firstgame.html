    <p class=articletext>On November 27th, 2017, I uploaded my first game to the internet. It sounds a lot more dramatic than it really was. In all honesty I was just sitting at my computer late at night, desperately trying to finish so I could go to sleep. I drank an energy drink earlier and my body was just about ready to give up. But I did it. The game was confusing, and not very well made. It had music that I have to admit i'm a little proud of, but terrible graphics and rough, buggy programming. But I'm glad I did it. I've tried making games for game jams before but I'd never been able to actually finish one. My game was almost universally panned. Obviously. The majority of people didn't even bother figuring out how to play it. But, for the people who did, they rated it mediocre at best. Honestly, just seeing a few people rate me above a few terrible games made me happy. The process was grueling. But now I want to make more. I want to become better. And now, with everyone's insights into my game, I finally can.</p>
