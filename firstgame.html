    <p class=articletext>On November 27th, 2017, I uploaded my first game to the internet. It sounds a lot more dramatic then it really was. In all honesty I was just sitting at my computer late at night, desperately trying to finish so I could go to sleep. I drank 2 redbulls earlier and my body was just about ready to give up. But I did it. The game was confusing, and not very well made. It had okay musics, but shitty graphics and programming. But I'm glad I did it. I've tried making games for game jams before but I'd never been able to actually finish one. It was almost universally panned. Obviously. The majority of people didn't even bother figuring out how to play it. The few people who actually did gave it a mediocre score. The game <em>was</em> very mediocre. But, as I said earlier, I am glad I finished it. I now know a lot more, especially because of the reviews, what to do and what not to do. It was an enjoyable experience overall.</p>
